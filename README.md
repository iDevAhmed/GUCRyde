      GUC Ryde

##About:

      GUC Ryde is a carpooling service implemented for GUCians where a user could request a driver who already asked if
      someone would like to join him on his way to GUC.
      
##How it works:      

      User logins in first using Facebook and then, chooses if he is a rider or if he wants to be picked up. Then, if he
      is a rider, the app will show all people around his area who want to be picked up. Using GPS, the app gets the postal 
      code of everyone connected (wants to be picked up) and people with the same postal code as the rider
      (surrouding area) will be shown to the rider. If the user picks pick up, he'll be shown an empty screen until a nearby
      rider picks him up. The pick up rider is yet to be implemented.
